"""Functions that simulate dice rolls.

A dice function takes no arguments and returns a number from 1 to n
(inclusive), where n is the number of sides on the dice.

Types of dice:

 -  Dice can be fair, meaning that they produce each possible outcome with equal
    probability.

 -  For testing functions that use dice, we use deterministic dice that always
    cycle among a fixed set of values when rolled.
